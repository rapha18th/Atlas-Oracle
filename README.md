# 🌍 Atlas Oracle

**Atlas Oracle** is a premium location-intelligence application that transforms raw geographic coordinates into grounded, structured business analysis. 

Designed for urban planners, real estate developers, and entrepreneurs, it replaces gut feeling with data-driven feasibility studies. It combines real-time satellite/POI data with Google Gemini's reasoning capabilities to generate startup concepts, cost estimates, and risk assessments for any location on Earth.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **📍 Precision Context**: Fetches real-time weather, elevation, and Points of Interest (POIs) using OpenStreetMap and Open-Meteo.
*   **🧠 AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** with Google Search Grounding to reason over the data, identifying specific business gaps and opportunities.
*   **💡 Concrete Opportunities**: Goes beyond generic advice by generating specific project concepts (e.g., "The Harbor Roast Lab") with estimated startup costs and rationale.
*   **📄 Professional Reports**: Generates detailed PDF feasibility briefs client-side.
*   **️🗣️ Voice Integration**: Features an interactive Voice Agent (via **ElevenLabs**) that holds full context of the location analysis for Q&A.
*   **🛡️ Resilience**: Implements intelligent fallbacks for public APIs (e.g., rotating Overpass servers) to ensure uptime.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Atlas Oracle runs entirely in the browser using ES Modules and React. It acts as an orchestrator between raw data providers and the Reasoning Engine.

## 🚀 How It Works

The application follows a strict four-step pipeline when a user clicks "Analyze Location":

### 1. Data Aggregation (The "Senses")
The app queries multiple public APIs in parallel:
*   **Overpass API (OSM)**: Scans the selected radius (1km-5km) for specific node types: `amenity`, `office`, `shop`, `highway`, and `landuse`. It uses a round-robin fallback strategy across German, French, and Russian mirror servers to handle rate limits.
*   **Nominatim**: Provides administrative context (Neighborhood, City, Zoning).
*   **Open-Meteo**: Fetches current weather code and precise elevation data.

### 2. Context Normalization
Raw JSON data is cleaned and condensed into a `Context` object. This removes noise (like specific node IDs) and formats the data for token-efficient LLM consumption.

### 3. Reasoning (The "Brain")
The normalized context is sent to **Google Gemini** with a system prompt that enforces:
*   **Strict JSON Output**: The model must return a specific schema containing arrays for risks, opportunities, and evidence.
*   **Search Grounding**: The model is instructed to use Google Search to verify local news or development plans that aren't visible in the raw OSM data.
*   **Creative Extrapolation**: The model invents plausible business names and calculates rough startup costs based on the identified economic tier of the location.

### 4. Presentation & Interaction
*   **Visual**: Results are rendered into "Cards" for quick reading.
*   **PDF**: A report is generated programmatically using the analysis data.
*   **Voice**: The structured analysis (Concept names, Costs, Risks) is injected as dynamic variables into an ElevenLabs Conversational AI session, allowing the user to "talk" to the location advisor.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS (No build step, served via ES Modules/ImportMap).
*   **Maps**: Leaflet & React-Leaflet.
*   **AI**: `@google/genai` SDK.
*   **Voice**: `@elevenlabs/react` SDK.
*   **PDF**: `jspdf`.

## 💻 Setup & Usage

This project uses a "No-Build" architecture. There is no `npm install` required for the application logic itself, as dependencies are loaded via CDN in `index.html`.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/atlas-oracle.git
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables**:
    You need a Google Gemini API Key. Since this is a client-side demo, you must serve the file in an environment where `process.env.API_KEY` is replaced, or strictly for local dev, you can hardcode it (not recommended for production).

    *Note: The ElevenLabs Agent ID is configured in `AtlasOracleCallModal.tsx`.*

3.  **Run Locally**:
    You can use any static file server.
    ```bash
    # Using python
    python3 -m http.server 8080

    # Using node http-server
    npx http-server .
    ```

4.  **Open in Browser**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## ⚠️ Data Constraints

*   **Overpass API**: Public instances have strict rate limits. If the analysis hangs, it is usually waiting for a slot on the OSM server. The app handles `504` and `429` errors by trying alternative servers.
*   **Cost Estimates**: Financial data generated by the AI are rough estimates based on general market data and should not be treated as financial advice.
